README for $JAVANLP_HOME/core/lib

Written by Bill MacCartney <wcmac@cs.stanford.edu> 23 January 2006
Updated by Daniel Ramage 16 October 2006

This directory is intended to contain only *current and necessary*
.jar files used with JavaNLP-core.  Each jar file in lib should be without
its version number but include a corresponding source .zip/.jar file
with a full version number in the libsrc folder.  For example, if
there is a file  lib/ra.jar there should be a corresponding and
up-to-date libsrc/ra-0.1.8-src.zip.

Outdated or redundant .jar files should NOT be kept here, but can
be stored instead in /u/nlp/java/liball.  Files in that directory
can have version numbers in the name.  Example: colt1.0.3.jar.

If you're adding a new .jar to the repository, please:
 - add the jar itself (without version number)
 - add its source zip (with version number)
 - check to make sure that the jar file doesn't have other libraries
   embedded within it (use jar -tf). if the .jar file has other libraries
   embedded which overlap with other javanlp libraries, please remove that
 - update the Eclipse .classpath file to include the jar and a path
   to its source,
 - also update this file with information about the jar
 - If it will be needed by releases of CoreNLP, also add it to the *2* pom files.
 - If it will be needed by releases of CoreNLP, also document the licensing in LIBRARY-LICENSES.

Any .jar files which appear in this directory should be listed in
this file, with the following information:

ORIGINAL JAR NAME: original name of the .jar file when downloaded

VERSION: version number

RELEASE DATE: when the library was originally released.

SOURCE AVAILABLE: yes or no, if it is available it should be checked in
to the repository under libsrc

DESCRIPTION: a short description of the library's function and purpose.

URL: where to check for library information, documentation, and updates.

USED BY: what JavaNLP packages use this library. (This need not be exhaustive,
but should list a couple of key packages that use/need this library.)
This should make clear whether it is neede by CoreNLP distributions.

LAST UPDATE: when we last updated our copy from the source.

LAST UPDATE BY: who last updated it
